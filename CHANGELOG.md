### Added

  * [Infobip SMS API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/sms)
    * Introduced `/sms/3/messages (V3)`  replacing the `/sms/2/text/advanced (V2)` and `/sms/2/binary/advanced (V2)` endpoints.
    * Introduced `/sms/3/reports (V3)` replacing `/sms/1/reports (V1)` endpoint.
    * Introduced `/sms/3/logs (V3)` replacing `/sms/1/logs (V1)` endpoint.
  * [Infobip 2FA](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/platform/2fa)
  * [Infobip Voice API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/voice)
* Support for:
  * [Infobip Moments API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/customer-engagement/moments).
  * [Infobip Email API](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/email)
* `calls.md` which contains examples and explanations for the Calls API.
* `build.yml` workflow to ensure project build and test integrity.
* `snyk.yml` workflow, which serves the purpose of identifying and addressing dependency vulnerabilities in the project.

### Changed
* **Fixes and changes**
  * Across all voice models, the 'applicationId' field has been removed and replaced with the `platform` field, as it better reflects the state of the endpoint.
  * Introduced the new [sms_message](infobip_api_client/models/sms_message.py) class to replace `sms_textual_message` and `sms_binary_message`, providing a unified structure for SMS messaging.
  * Added a content field within `sms_message` to define the message content. This supports both textual and binary messages, which can be created using [sms_text_content](infobip_api_client/models/sms_text_content.py) or [sms_binary_content](infobip_api_client/models/sms_binary_content.py), respectively.
  * Unified request classes by replacing `sms_advaned_textual_request` and `sms_advaned_binary_request` with the new [sms_request](infobip_api_client/models/sms_request.py) class.
  * Consolidated sending functions: use `send_sms_messages` instead of the `send_sms_message` and `send_binary_sms_message` functions.
  * Removed delivery time window configuration classes (`sms_delivery_time_window`, `call_routing_allowed_time_window`, `calls_delivery_time_window`, `calls_time_window`) in favor of a unified class: [delivery_time_window](infobip_api_client/models/delivery_time_window.py)
  * Removed delivery time configuration classes (`sms_delivery_time_to`, `sms_delivery_time_from`, `calls_time_windows_point`, `call_routing_allowed_time_from`, `call_routing_allowed_time_to`) in favor of a unified class: [delivery_time](infobip_api_client/models/delivery_time.py)
  * Removed URL options configuration class (`sms_url_options`) in favor of a unified class: [url_options](infobip_api_client/models/url_options.py)
  * Removed TurkeyIys options configuration class (`sms_turkey_iys_options`) in favor of a unified class: [turkey_iys_options](infobip_api_client/models/turkey_iys_options.py)
  * Removed delivery day enumeration classes (`sms_delivery_day`, `calls_delivery_day`, `call_routing_allowed_day`) in favor of a unified class: [delivery_day](infobip_api_client/models/delivery_day.py)
  * Removed speed limit time unit enumeration class (`sms_speed_limit_time_unit`) in favor of a unified class: [speed_limit_time_unit](infobip_api_client/models/speed_limit_time_unit.py)
  * Renamed class from `calls_public_conference_recording` to `calls_conference_recording`.
  * Renamed class from `calls_pegasus_provider` to `calls_provider`.
  * Renamed class from `calls_pegasus_provider_trunk_type` to `calls_provider_trunk_type`.
